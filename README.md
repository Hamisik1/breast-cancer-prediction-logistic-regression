## 📌 Objective

To create a predictive model that classifies whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using features extracted from digitized images of breast masses.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- 569 instances and 30 numeric features
- Binary target: `diagnosis` → Malignant (M) or Benign (B)

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- **Kaggle Notebook**


---

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Visualization and correlation analysis  
4. Splitting data into train/test sets  
5. Training a Logistic Regression model  
6. Evaluating performance with metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

---

## ✅ Results

- **Model Accuracy**: 96%
- Precision, recall, and F1-score indicate strong performance in both benign and malignant prediction.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Basics of binary classification
- Logistic regression modeling
- Importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualizing model performance with confusion matrices
