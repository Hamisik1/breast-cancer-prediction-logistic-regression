📊 Breast Cancer Detection with Logistic Regression
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses Logistic Regression to detect whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on real-world breast cancer morphology data from scikit-learn.

🧠 Built with: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

🔍 Highlights
Loaded and explored the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset

Visualized key relationships using Seaborn & Matplotlib

Built a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and Accuracy

Achieved 96% accuracy on test data

🚀 Next Steps
🔁 Try more advanced models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)

🧠 Add explainability tools like SHAP or LIME

📱 Package the model into a simple health app or REST API

🌍 Apply similar techniques to real-world healthcare datasets

📚 Learnings
This project strengthened my understanding of:

Logistic Regression for binary classification

Data preprocessing and train/test split

Interpreting evaluation metrics in health contexts
