# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression

This beginner-friendly project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on real-world breast cancer data. The project walks through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using key metrics.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To build a simple machine learning model that predicts breast cancer diagnoses from morphology-based features, while demonstrating good evaluation practices and next steps.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
- **Features**: Radius, texture, smoothness, etc.
- **Target**: Diagnosis (`M` for malignant, `B` for benign)

## ðŸ§  Model
- Logistic Regression using scikit-learn
- Train-test split: 80/20
- Accuracy achieved: **96%**

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- ROC Curve and AUC

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Try more advanced models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
- Use model explainability tools like SHAP or LIME
- Package the model in a health app or REST API
- Apply to real-world healthcare datasets
